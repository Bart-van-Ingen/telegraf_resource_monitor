# the session's history is lost. `history -a` appends new lines immediately; `history -n`
# reads back lines other shells have appended, so Ctrl-R sees them without a restart.
# Only meaningful in the interactive shells that source this file via .bashrc; harmless
# when this script runs as the container ENTRYPOINT.
